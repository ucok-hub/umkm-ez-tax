        <option value="I was hoping you could make the file that I chose so you can understand it and make a reference. I need you to make the contents of the menu page on the bottom left on the bottom navbar. In it, I plan to have a user profile photo and registered email positioned right below the user's pfp. Then we enter the discussion of the main content of the 'menu' page, I want the contents to consist of various vertical menu options that the user can choose, later I plan to hold 3 possibilities. First, there will be settings (later in the plan, there will be dark mode only with the implementation using switches). Second, there will be the &quot;build info,&quot; if clicked by the user, the user will be redirected to the build info page, which contains the application version; third, there will be about the developers, which will include the names of the developers. What do you think of my idea? Is it good enough? Try to give your opinion! Don't start executing before my decision." />

        <option value="I want on the calculate page, I want when the user selects the 2025 onwards option, you can notice there is a column 'masukkan norma %.&quot; well, it turns out that the user has to search first on the tax web to be able to determine the type of norm he is. Therefore, I want you to add a blue text that can be clicked that says &quot;CEK NORMA ANDA DISINI,&quot; and I also want to add a change. When the info button is clicked, a piece of information will appear. Still, it is static, not dynamic, and not relevant to the option (under 2025/2025onwards/progressive tax with bookkeeping) clicked by the user; I want the info displayed to the user when clicking the info button to be relevant. Then, regarding the 2025 onwards option, here is the destination link: &#10;&#10;https://datacenter.ortax.org/ortax/norma/norma&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;I also want to add information on the 2025 onwards option inside the info button; here is the additional information: &#10;&#10;&quot;NPPN adalah metode penghitungan penghasilan neto bagi wajib pajak orang pribadi yang menjalankan usaha atau pekerjaan bebas.&#10;&#10;Dalam metode ini, penghasilan neto dihitung dengan cara mengalikan persentase norma tertentu terhadap penghasilan bruto yang diperoleh.&#10;&#10;Untuk pengecekan lebih lanjut, silakan klik link di bawah kolom angka &quot;masukkan norma.&quot; &quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;How about it?
